* Features

- Procedural landscape with Perlin noise
  - Multiple noise support
  - Increased control with a height curve
  - Erosion
    - Thermal
    - Wind
    - Falloff
- Object placement system
- Texturing
- Chunking System
  - Distance based LOD

* How to use?

Add =ProceduralTerrain= and =TerrainChunker= to a object. =ProceduralTerrain= will spawn a preview object so you can watch the changes. =TerrainChunker= infinitely chunks terrain at run-time.

Then, you need to play with the script parameters. Most of the parameters are packed and serialized. You can create a parameter asset through project context menu.

* Preview Scenes

Check directories in [[file:Assets/Scenes/]]. There are some scenes with a biome theme.

* FAQ

** Is this production ready?

No, it is not.

While you certainly can do, I wouldn't recommend it myself. It can be a lot efficient, flexible and also clean. Though you can use this project as a reference point. 

** I see code similarities, why is that?

You are right!

This was a learning journey for me so I followed a couple of guides on the way.
